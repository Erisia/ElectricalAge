## ABOUT

Here is some highlighted features:

A better simulation
> Electrical simulation with resistive and capacitive effects. Behavior similar to those of real life objects.

Multiple electrical machines and components
> Furnaces, Solar panels, Wind turbines, Batteries, Capacitors, ...

Break the cube
> Cables, sensors, actuators, alarms, etc. can be placed on each face (outer and inner) of a cube, which allows a significant reduction of the consumed space by electrical installations.

Night-lighting revisited
> Lamps, switches, captors, ...

Small and big electrical consumers
> From lamps and electrical furnaces to miners and transporters...

Incredible tools
> X-Ray scanner, flashlight, portable mining drill...

Interoperability
> Old redstone circuits can be exploited with electrical <-> redstone converters.

Game lifetime/complexity extended
> A consequent list of new raw materials and items...
